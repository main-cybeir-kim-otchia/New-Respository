        <h2>This contains a bit more description about myself</h2>
        <p>I am a second-year college student who would describe myself as outgoing, enthusiastic, and passionate about the things Iâ€™m interested in. I stay focused and am always striving to learn and grow, viewing difficult situations as opportunities rather than obstacles. I strive to make decisions that reflect independence and courage. I also consider myself a good friend, always aiming to support those around me.</p>
